## Summary

pre-cr-suite-lsp is a coverage-first pre-PR readiness workflow for VS Code and Neovim, centered on running a pre-review coverage check, refreshing coverage overlays, and fixing setup issues from shared repo config. The repo is positioned as a public beta with a narrow, explicit promise rather than a broad tool suite, and `.planning/` now exists to drive the next release-hardening phases.

## Context

The README and `docs/ROADMAP.md` both describe the public beta scope: `Run Pre-CR Check`, `Refresh Coverage`, and `Fix Setup`, with VS Code and Neovim as first-class clients. The repo is a TypeScript monorepo whose release gates require build, lint, test, typecheck, packaging, and parity verification from a clean clone.

## Risks

The main risk is parity drift between clients while experimental features continue to live in-repo. The product should stay disciplined around the beta workflow until those release gates are routinely passing.

## Recent Documentation Updates

- 2026-07-01: Added a recruiter-facing README snapshot and a structured "Why This Matters" section covering problem, audience, build scope, technical decisions, run commands, and next improvements. `git diff --check` passed for the documentation change.
